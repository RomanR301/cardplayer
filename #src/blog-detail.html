            <p><strong> Alex Fitzgerald</strong> and <strong>Steve Blay </strong> believe that most poker players
              possess poker knowledge that is not
              evidenced
              in their actual play. Even novice poker players are keenly aware that aggressive strategies are essential
              to
              profitability. Whether knowing to punish limpers, 3-bet with a range of hands beyond AA and KK, c-bet, or
              mix in well-timed bluffs, players must manage to win pots without the best hand.</p>
            <p> If poker players have this knowledge, what is holding them back from its execution? Blay and Fitzgerald
              believe the cause is very simple: fear.
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to overcome this crippling roadblock, they have combined their efforts to produce a course with
              over 20 videos and extensive supplemental materials designed to help the modern player combat fear. Poker
              without Fear is the most complete package available with the single goal of assisting every player to
              maximize his or her aggressive potential.
            </p>
            <h2>Getting Out of Your Comfort Zone</h2>
            <p>Fitzgerald and Blay share a foundational belief: the majority of poker players, regardless of experience,
              exhibit the same flaws in their games. Their play is based on emotional and personal factors, rather than
              on quality play rooted in logic, odds, and data. For example, a player may have mastered open raising
              pre-flop and calling with decent hands in position, but their primary drive is the desire to see the flop
              and be a part of the action. The FOMO (fear of missing out) principle is high among poker players. If a
              player folds small, suited connectors to a large raise and then flops a straight with a redraw to the
              flush, he is distraught. So rather than correctly folding those suited connectors out of position, he
              calls and ends up losing his 6 high flush to the nut flush on the river.
            </p>
            <p> Conversely, FOLS (fear of looking stupid) is an equally strong driver. FOLS arises when a player
              realizes
              that he may get caught in a move which seems illogical to other players and will evoke mocking or scorn.
              You may know that you should re-raise a c-bettor on a flop that likely missed his range and gave you a
              9-high flush draw and a backdoor straight draw. Instead, FOLS makes you convince yourself that he hit a
              set, and you just call in hopes of hitting your flush, folding when you miss the turn and he bets again.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout this course, Fitzgerald and Blay challenge players to confront these tendencies and rather to
              rely on proven strategies that lead to greater profits. Blay has devised 10 challenges, illustrated below,
              that force players to practice aggressive actions until they become more comfortable with this type of
              play.</p>
